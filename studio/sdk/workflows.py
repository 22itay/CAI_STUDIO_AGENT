    """
    Run a workflow based on the workflow name, and return the ID of the workflow
    run which can then be used to query the status of that specific workflow run.

    Params:
    - workflow_name: the name of the workflow to run. It is currently assumed that every
    workflow has just one deployed workflow instance, so for now we extract the deployed
    workflow information from just the workflow name.
    - workflow_id: if you know the Agent Studio id of the workflow, you can call the
    workflow directly from the id
    - inputs: a dictionary of inputs to the workflow. For standard (sequential) workflows,
    this will be a key-value pair of all input fields created during task creation steps.
    If this is a conversational workflow, then there are exactly two input keys expected:
    "user_input" and "context". "user_input" is the most recent chat message and "context"
    is the entire context of the previous conversation, formatted however you want.

    Returns:
    - a workflow run ID that can be used with get_workflow_events() to track workflow run.

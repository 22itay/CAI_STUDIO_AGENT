## Getting Started

### User Guide
The usual process of using the studio is as follows:
 1. Configure an AI model to use. ([Models User Guide](./docs/user_guide/models.md))
 2. Create new tools or go through our existing set of tools. *This step is optional.* ([Tools User Guide](./docs/user_guide/tools.md))
 3. Create, test, deploy and manage workflows. ([Workflows User Guide](./docs/user_guide/workflows.md))
 4. Monitor your workflows. ([Monitoring User Guide](./docs/user_guide/monitoring.md))
 5. Build custom UIs and [Applications](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/applications/topics/ml-applications-c.html) on top of your deployed workflows. ([Custom Applications Guide](./docs/user_guide/custom_workflow_application.md))

## High Level Features
- Agent Studio ships with a set of pre-built tools and workflows (called "templates"). Use these to get started quickly.
- Create custom tools and workflows. Test the workflows in the studio. Save them as templates for reuse.
- Workflows can be deployed as standalone [Workbench Applications](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/applications/topics/ml-applications-c.html), and can be used indipendently of the studio.

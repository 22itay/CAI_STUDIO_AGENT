## About the Studio
Cloudera AI Agent Studio is a low-code and powerful platform for building, testing, and deploying AI agents and workflows. It provides an intuitive interface for creating custom AI tools and combining them into sophisticated automated workflows.

- Agent Studio ships with a set of pre-built tools and workflows (called "templates"). Use these to get started quickly.
- Users can create custom agents, tools and workflows. Test the workflows in the Studio. Save them as templates for reuse.
- Workflows can be deployed as a Workbench Model, ready for production use.
